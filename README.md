# Advance-Statistics-for-Physics-Analysis-
In this report are reported the exercises from my university course Advance Statistics for Physics Analysis. All the Jupyter 
Notebook are written in the docker image jupyter/r-notebook, which I highly recomend. 
The exercise are all written in the `R` language.
- Lab 0 is an introduction to the language
- Lab 1 is an overview on how to treat complicate `tibble`
- Lab 2 is related to PDF and CDF
